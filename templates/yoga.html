           <b class="text-4xl font-light">Yoga</b><br><br>
            There are six branches of yoga. Each branch represents a different focus and set of characteristics.
            The six branches are:
            <br><br><b style="color: black;">Hatha yoga:</b> This is the physical and mental branch that aims to prime the body and mind.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Raja yoga:</b> This branch involves meditation and strict adherence to a series of disciplinary steps known as the eight limbs of yoga.
            </b>Karma yoga: This is a path of service that aims to create a future free from negativity and selfishness.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Bhakti yoga:</b> This aims to establish the path of devotion, a positive way to channel emotions and cultivate acceptance and tolerance.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Jnana yoga:</b> This branch of yoga is about wisdom, the path of the scholar, and developing the intellect through study.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Tantra yoga:</b> This is the pathway of ritual, ceremony, or consummation of a relationship.
            <br><br><b style="color: black;">Chakras</b><br>
            The word “chakra” means“spinning wheel.”
            Yoga maintains that chakras are center points of energy, thoughts, feelings, and the physical body. According to yogic teachers, chakras determine how people experience reality through emotional reactions, desires or aversions, levels of confidence or fear, and even physical symptoms and effects.
            When energy becomes blocked in a chakra, it triggers physical, mental, or emotional imbalances that manifest in symptoms such as anxiety, lethargy, or poor digestion.
            Asanas are the many physical poses in Hatha yoga. People who practice yoga use asanas to free energy and stimulate an imbalanced chakra.
            There are seven major chakras, each with its own focus:<br>
            <br><b style="color: black;">Sahasrara:</b> The crown chakra, which is at the crown of the head, symbolizes spiritual connection.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Ajna:</b> Located between the eyebrows, the third eye chakra has to do with intuition.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Vishuddha:</b> The throat chakra corresponds to immunity and verbal communication.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Anahata:</b> The heart chakra, which is in the center of the chest, influences professional and personal relationships. Any imbalances in this chakra will affect oxygen, hormones, tissue, and organ control.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Manipura:</b> The solar plexus chakra is in the stomach area. It corresponds to self-confidence, wisdom, and self-discipline.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Svadhishthana:</b> The sacral chakra, which is beneath the belly button, connects pleasure, well-being, and vitality.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Muladhara:</b> The root chakra, which is at the base of the spine, connects the mind and body to the earth to keep a person grounded. It controls the sciatic nerves and the parasympathetic nervous system.
            <br><br><b style="color: black;">Types</b><br>
            Modern yoga focuses on exercise, strength, agility, and breathing.  It boosts physical and mental well-being.
            There are many styles of yoga. A person should choose a style based on their goals and fitness level.
            Types and styles of yoga:
            <br><b style="color: black;">Ashtanga yoga</b>
            This type of yoga practice uses ancient yoga teachings. However, it became popular during the 1970s.
            Ashtanga applies the same poses and sequences that rapidly link every movement to breath.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Bikram yoga</b>
            People practice Bikram yoga, also known as hot yoga, in artificially heated rooms at a temperature of nearly 105oF and 40% humidity. It consists of 26 poses and a sequence of two breathing exercises.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Hatha yoga</b>
            This is a generic term for any type of yoga that teaches physical poses. Hatha classes usually serve as a gentle introduction to the basic poses of yoga.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Iyengar yoga</b>
            This type of yoga practice focuses on finding the correct alignment in each pose with the help of a range of props, such as blocks, blankets, straps, chairs, and bolsters.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Kripalu yoga</b>
            This type teaches practitioners to know, accept, and learn from the body. A student of Kripalu yoga learns to find their own level of practice by looking inward.
            The classes usually begin with breathing exercises and gentle stretches, followed by a series of individual poses and final relaxation.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Kundalini yoga</b>
            Kundalini yoga is a system of meditation that aims to release pent-up energy.
            A Kundalini yoga class typically begins with chanting and ends with singing. In between, it features asana, pranayama, and meditation that aim to create a specific outcome.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Power yoga</b>
            In the late 1980s, practitioners developed this active and athletic type of yoga based on the traditional Ashtanga system.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Sivananda</b>
            This system uses a five point philosophy as its foundation.
            This philosophy maintains that proper breathing, relaxation, diet, exercise, and positive thinking work together to create a healthy yogic lifestyle.
            People practicing Sivananda use 12 basic asanas, which they precede with Sun Salutations and follow with Savasana.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Viniyoga</b>
            Viniyoga focuses on form over function, breath and adaptation, repetition and holding, and the art and science of sequencing.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Yin yoga</b>
            Yin yoga places its focus on holding passive poses for long periods of time. This style of yoga targets deep tissues, ligaments, joints, bones, and fascia.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Prenatal yoga</b>
            Prenatal yoga uses poses that practitioners have created with pregnant people in mind. This yoga style can help people get back into shape after giving birth, and support health during pregnancy.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Restorative yoga</b>
            This is a relaxing method of yoga. A person spends a restorative yoga class in four or five simple poses, using props such as blankets and bolsters to sink into deep relaxation without exerting any effort when holding the pose.
