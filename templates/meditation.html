          <b class="text-4xl font-light">Meditation</b><br><br>
            Meditation is practiced in one of three modes:
            <br><b style="color: black;">Concentration:</b> focusing attention on a single object, internal or external (focused attention meditation)
            <br><b style="color: black;">Observation:</b> paying attention to whatever is predominant in your experience in the present moment, without allowing the attention to get stuck on any particular thing (open monitoring meditation)
            <br><b style="color: black;">Awareness:</b> allowing awareness to remain present, undistracted and not engaged with either focusing or observing
            <br><br>Other characteristics of meditation include:
            Meditation is an individual practice, even if done in groups (such as in a meditation retreat).
            Meditation is often done with eyes closed, but not always (Zazen and Trakat, for example, are open-eye styles of meditation)
            Meditation usually involves bodily stillness. But there are also ways to do walking meditation, and to integrate mindfulness in other activities.
            Originally, the word “meditate” actually means to think deeply about something. However, when eastern contemplative practices were “imported” to Western culture, this is the term that was used to define them, for lack of a better word. Nowadays meditation has more the meaning of this exercise of focusing attention than to reflect deeply.
            Here are some other definitions of meditation.
            <br>In Christianity, meditation is a type of contemplative prayer that creates a sense of union with God, or the contemplation of religious themes.
            In Buddhism, meditation is one of the three core practices for the purification of mind and attainment of Nirvana.
            Besides focus of attention, meditation also involves mental calmness and introspection (“looking within”). Meditation is, thus, somewhat different than other personal development or spiritual exercises, such as:
            <br><b style="color: black;">-</b> Affirmation, self-hypnosis, or guided visualization—where the objective is more to imprint a specific message on the mind
            <br><b style="color: black;">-</b> Pure relaxation—where the goal is only to release bodily tensions.
            <br><b style="color: black;">-</b> Prayer—where there is a conscious flow of thinking and feeling, directed towards a Deity
            <br><b style="color: black;">-</b> Contemplation—where the thought process is actively engaged in order to deepen the understanding of a subject or concept.
            <br><b style="color: black;">-</b> Trance dancing—where the main goal is usually to produce visions or an altered state of consciousness
            <br><b style="color: black;">-</b> Breathing exercises like pranayama and (most types of) qigong— where the focus is on producing a certain pattern of breathing and purifying the body.
            <br>All these practices are also good and helpful, but they are different from meditation (although some meditation techniques may make use of some of these elements).

            <br><br><b style="color: black;">The Benefits of Meditation</b><br>
            There are dozens of scientifically proven benefits of meditation. Studies confirm the experience of millions of practitioners: meditation will keep you healthy, help prevent multiple diseases, make you emotionally well, and improve your performance in basically any task, physical or mental.
            Some of the benefits come as soon as 8 weeks of daily practice; other benefits take longer to mature, and will depend on your intensity of practice.
            <br>Meditation is good for several things, and it’s different for different people.  However, it is usually one of these three things that drive people to practice:
            <br><br><b style="color: black;">Specific benefit:</b> improving your health, wellbeing, performance, focus.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Growth:</b> emotional healing, self-knowledge, Self -discipline, letting go.
            <br><b style="color: black;">Spirituality:</b> connecting with God, inner peace, and other spiritual goals.<br><br>
            Whatever drives you to meditate, that is good. You will get the benefits you seek, in the proportion of your consistency and commitment to building this habit. But the wider you cast your net, the more fish you will get — so I would encourage you to practice not only for one particular reason, but for the sake of the practice itself.
            Your motivation may also evolve by time, as the practice starts to unfold in your life.
            <br><br><b style="color: black;">Meditation Tips</b><br>
            Here are some general guidelines on the practice:
            <br>Posture: you can meditate seated on a cushion or on a chair. The essential thing about posture is that the spine is absolutely erect, from the lower back to the neck, and ideally not leaning on anything.
            Time: the best time to meditate is first thing in the morning, so you don’t skip it, and the impact on your day is stronger—but any time that works for you is fine!
            <br>Place: a spot where you can sit uninterrupted. Ideally a place that is quiet, clean and tidy, in order to create a better influence on the mind.
            <br>Length: you can start with as little as 5minutes, and increase 1 or 2 minutes per week, until you arrive at 20 min sessions and beyond.
            Here are six other tips to make sure your practice is optimal. They are not mandatory, but they make your meditation go easier:<br>
            <br><b style="color: black;">-</b> Your body should not be exhausted. So ideally not right after heavy exercise.
            <br><b style="color: black;">-</b> Your mind should be awake. So not good when you are sleepy or tired.
            <br><b style="color: black;">-</b> Your belly should not be full. Wait 2~3 hours after heavy meals.
            <br><b style="color: black;">-</b> Put your phone on airplane mode during your practice.
            <br><b style="color: black;">-</b> Relax your body with deep breathing exercises before meditation.
            <br><b style="color: black;">-</b> If you are meditating at home, wear clothes that are comfortable and loose.
            <br>Once you choose your technique, the next step is to work on building the meditation habit (section below), and having a better understanding of the process of meditation.
